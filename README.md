# HGSOC-GROWTH-KINETICS
This is a repository with the codes and raw data required to reproduce the results in the paper Growth Kinetics of HGSOC - implications for early detection

The software used for this project are

- Python (3.12.7)
- matplotlib (3.9.2)
- numpy (1.26.4)
- pandas (2.2.2)
- scipy (1.15.1)

- MATLAB (R2024b Update 1 (24.2.0.2740171))
- Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox

There are the following folders:
- data: contains the raw volumes used for analysis
- scripts: contains the Python and Matlab scripts used for analysis
- output: plots and results of all the analyses

Each folder contains its own README file. While running the MATLAB scripts, please make sure your working directory is the main HGSOC-GROWTH-KINETICS directory; the relative paths are set with respect to this.
